PyNN
====

PyNN (pronounced '*pine*') is a simulator-independent language for building
neuronal network models.

In other words, you can write the code for a model once, using the PyNN API and
the Python programming language, and then run it without modification on any
simulator that PyNN supports (currently NEURON, NEST and Brian) and
on a number of neuromorphic hardware systems.

The PyNN API aims to support modelling at a high-level of abstraction
(populations of neurons, layers, columns and the connections between them) while
still allowing access to the details of individual neurons and synapses when
required. PyNN provides a library of standard neuron, synapse and synaptic
plasticity models, which have been verified to work the same on the different
supported simulators. PyNN also provides a set of commonly-used connectivity
algorithms (e.g. all-to-all, random, distance-dependent, small-world) but makes
it easy to provide your own connectivity in a simulator-independent way.

Even if you don't wish to run simulations on multiple simulators, you may
benefit from writing your simulation code using PyNN's powerful, high-level
interface. In this case, you can use any neuron or synapse model supported by
your simulator, and are not restricted to the standard models.
