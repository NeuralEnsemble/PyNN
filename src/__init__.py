"""
PyNN (pronounced 'pine') is a Python package for simulator-independent
specification of neuronal network models. 

In other words, you can write the code for a model once, using the PyNN API, and
then run it without modification on any simulator that PyNN supports. 

To use PyNN, import the particular simulator module you wish to use, e.g.
    import pyNN.neuron as sim
all subsequent code in the `sim` namespace will then have the same behaviour
independent of simulator.

Functions for simulation set-up and control:
    setup()
    run()
    run_until()
    reset()
    end()
    get_time_step()
    get_current_time()
    get_min_delay()
    get_max_delay()
    rank()
    num_processes()
    list_standard_models()
    
Functions for creating, connecting, modifying and recording from neurons
(low-level interface):
    create()
    connect()
    set()
    record()
    initialize()
