The PyNN API provides a uniform interface to different simulators, but
nevertheless each simulator has features that are not available in other
simulators, and we aim to make these features accessible, as much as possible,
from PyNN.

For each simulator backend, this section presents the configuration options
specific to that backend and explains how to use "native" neuron and synapse
models within the PyNN framework.
