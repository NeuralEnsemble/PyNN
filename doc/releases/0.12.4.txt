=========================
PyNN 0.12.4 release notes
=========================

April 2nd 2025

Welcome to PyNN 0.12.4!

New documentation theme
-----------------------

Many thanks to @sdivyanshu90 for suggesting use of the sphinxawesome_ theme,
which fixes some problems with over-flowing side-bars,
and in general provides much nicer navigation through the documentation_.


NEST 3.8 support
----------------

PyNN now supports NEST_ v3.8.
NEST 3.4-3.7 should also work for most neuron models, but since the extension module interface
has changed in NEST 3.7, those models that require NEST extensions will not work with older versions.
For older versions of NEST, you will need an older version of PyNN to match.

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix some problems with creating SpikeTrain objects, following the addition of SpikeTrainList to Neo.
- Correctly set parameters when creating a point neuron with no synapses, with the neuron backend.
- Correctly write equations for Brian2 when creating a point neuron with no synapses.

Dependency updates
------------------

We have dropped support for Python 3.8.
This version should also work with NumPy v2+.
