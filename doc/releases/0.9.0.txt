PyNN 0.9.0 release notes
========================

April 12th 2017

Welcome to PyNN 0.9.0!

This version of PyNN adopts the new, simplified Neo_ object model, first released as Neo 0.5.0,
for the data structures returned by :class:`Population.get_data()`.
For more information on the new Neo API, see the `release notes`_.

The main difference for a PyNN user is that the :class:`AnalogSignalArray` class has been renamed
to :class:`AnalogSignal`, and similarly the :attr:`Segment.analogsignalarrays` attribute is now
called :attr:`Segment.analogsignals`.

In addition, a `number of bugs`_ with current injection for the :mod:`pyNN.brian` module have been fixed.
