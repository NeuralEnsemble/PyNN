PyNN 0.11.0 release notes
=========================

May 23rd 2022

Welcome to PyNN 0.11.0!


Added "composed" models allowing multiple post-synaptic receptor types
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The existing PyNN "standard" models are defined by both their membrane properties
(e.g., "leaky integrate-and-fire", "exponential integrate-and-fire") and by the
number of type of their post-synaptic receptor currents (e.g., "alpha-shaped",
"single-exponential", "excitatory", "inhibitory").

A new, optional class, :class:`PointNeuron`, now allows cell types to be composed
from a menu of membrane mechanisms (currently :class:`LIF` or :class:`AdExp`)
and of an arbitrary number of post-synaptic response mechanisms:

- :class:`CurrExpPostSynapticResponse`
- :class:`CondExpPostSynapticResponse` (alias :class:`ExpPSR`)
- :class:`CondAlphaPostSynapticResponse` (alias :class:`AlphaPSR`)
- :class:`CondBetaPostSynapticResponse` (alias :class:`BetaPSR`)

Example::

    celltype = sim.PointNeuron(
        sim.AdExp(tau_m=10.0, v_rest=-60.0),
        AMPA=sim.AlphaPSR(tau_syn=1.0, e_syn=0.0),
        NMDA=sim.AlphaPSR(tau_syn=20.0, e_syn=0.0),
        GABAA=sim.AlphaPSR(tau_syn=1.5, e_syn=-70.0),
        GABAB=sim.AlphaPSR(tau_syn=15.0, e_syn=-90.0))


NEST 3.4 support
----------------

PyNN now supports the latest version of NEST_. NEST 3.3 should also work.
For older versions of NEST, you will need an older version of PyNN to match.

Changes for developers
----------------------

Most of the changes in this version of PyNN are not visible to the end user,
but are intended to improve the developer experience, for both existing and
new developers, and to bring PyNN up to date with current best practices
for open-source Python projects:

- Moved test suite from nose to pytest
- Changed packing solution from setup.py to pyproject.toml
- Fixed a lot of warnings produced by the flake8_ style checker
- Internal refactoring and spring-cleaning, intended to remove old code and make the code base easier to understand
