Introduction
============

PyNN_ (pronounced 'pine') is a simulator-independent language for building neuronal network models.

In other words, you can write the code for a model once, using the PyNN API and the Python_ programming language, and then run it without modification on any simulator that PyNN supports (currently NEURON_, NEST_ and `Brian 2`_) as well as on certain neuromorphic hardware systems.

The PyNN API aims to support modelling at a high-level of abstraction (populations of neurons, layers, columns and the connections between them) while still allowing access to the details of individual neurons and synapses when required. PyNN provides a library of standard neuron, synapse and synaptic plasticity models, which have been verified to work the same on the different supported simulators. PyNN also provides a set of commonly-used connectivity algorithms (e.g. all-to-all, random, distance-dependent, small-world) but makes it easy to provide your own connectivity in a simulator-independent way, either using the Connection Set Algebra (`Djurfeldt, 2012`_) or by writing your own Python code.

Even if you don't wish to run simulations on multiple simulators, you may benefit from writing your simulation code using PyNN's powerful, high-level interface. In this case, you can use any neuron or synapse model supported by your simulator, and are not restricted to the standard models. PyNN transparently supports distributed simulations (using MPI) where the underlying simulator does.

It is straightforward to port an existing model from a Python-supporting simulator to PyNN, since this can be done incrementally, replacing one piece of simulator-specific code at a time with the PyNN equivalent, and testing that the model behaviour is unchanged at each step.
