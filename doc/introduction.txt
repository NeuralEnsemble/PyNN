Introduction
============

PyNN (pronounced 'pine' ) is a simulator-independent language for building neuronal network models. 

In other words, you can write the code for a model once, using the PyNN API and the Python_ programming language, and then run it without modification on any simulator that PyNN supports (currently NEURON_, NEST_, PCSIM_ and Brian_).

The API has two parts, a [wiki:LowLevelAPI low-level, procedural API] (functions ``create()``, ``connect()``, ``set()``, ``record()``, ``record_v()``), and a [wiki:HighLevelAPI high-level, object-oriented API] (classes ``Population`` and ``Projection``, which have methods like ``set()``, ``record()``, ``setWeights()``, etc.). 

The low-level API is good for small networks, and perhaps gives more flexibility. The high-level API is good for hiding the details and the book-keeping, allowing you to concentrate on the overall structure of your model.

The other thing that is required to write a model once and run it on multiple simulators is standard cell and synapse models. PyNN translates standard cell-model names and parameter names into simulator-specific names, e.g. standard model ``IF_curr_alpha`` is ``iaf_neuron`` in NEST and ``StandardIF`` in NEURON, while ``SpikeSourcePoisson`` is a ``poisson_generator`` in NEST and a ``NetStim`` in NEURON.

Even if you don't wish to run simulations on multiple simulators, you may benefit from writing your simulation code using PyNN's powerful, high-level interface. In this case, you can use any neuron or synapse model supported by your simulator, and are not restricted to the standard models.

PyNN is a work in progress, but is already being used for several large-scale simulation projects.
