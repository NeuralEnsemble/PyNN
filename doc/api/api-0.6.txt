=========================================================================

----

Population
----------

An array of neurons all of the same type. `Population' is used as a generic
term intended to include layers, columns, nuclei, etc., of cells.

**__getitem__(self, addr)**

Return a representation of the cell with coordinates given by addr,
suitable for being passed to other methods that require a cell id.
Note that !__getitem!__ is called when using [] access, e.g.

    p = Population(...)

    p[2,3] is equivalent to p.!__getitem!__((2,3)).

Also accepts slices, e.g.

    p[0,3:6]

which returns an array of cells.


**__init__(self, dims, cellclass, cellparams=None, label=None)**

Create a population of neurons all of the same type.

dims should be a tuple containing the population dimensions, or a single
  integer, for a one-dimensional population.
  e.g., (10,10) will create a two-dimensional population of size 10x10.

cellclass should either be a standardized cell class (a class inheriting
from common.!StandardCellType) or a string giving the name of the
simulator-specific model that makes up the population.
cellparams should be a dict which is passed to the neuron model constructor
label is an optional name for the population.


**__iter__(self)**

Iterator over cell ids on the local node.


**__len__(self)**

Return the total number of cells in the population.


**addresses(self)**

Iterator over cell addresses on the local node.


**all(self)**

Iterator over cell ids on all nodes.


**can_record(self, variable)**

Determine whether `variable` can be recorded from this population.


**describe(self, template='standard', fill=<function <lambda> at 0x2854470>)**

Returns a human-readable description of the population


**get(self, parameter_name, as_array=False)**

Get the values of a parameter for every cell in the population.


**getSpikes(self, gather=True, compatible_output=True)**

recorded cells.
Useful for small populations, for example for single neuron Monte-Carlo.

Return a 3-column numpy array containing cell ids and synaptic
conductances for recorded cells.


*get_spike_counts(self, gather=True)**

Returns the number of spikes for each neuron.


**get_v(self, gather=True, compatible_output=True)**

Return a 2-column numpy array containing cell ids and Vm for
recorded cells.


**id_to_index(self, id)**

Given the ID of a cell in the Population, return its index (order in the
Population).
>>> assert id_to_index(p.index(5)) == 5


**ids(self)**

Iterator over cell ids on the local node.


**index(self, n)**

Return the nth cell in the population (Indexing starts at 0).
n may be a list or array, e.g., [i,j,k], in which case, returns the
ith, jth and kth cells in the population.


**inject(self, current_source)**

Connect a current source to all cells in the Population.


**locate(self, id)**

Given an element id in a Population, return the coordinates.

              7 9


**meanSpikeCount(self, gather=True)**

Returns the mean number of spikes per neuron.


**nearest(self, position)**

Return the neuron closest to the specified position.


**printSpikes(self, file, gather=True, compatible_output=True)**

Write spike times to file.

file should be either a filename or a PyNN File object.

If compatible_output is True, the format is "spiketime cell_id",
where cell_id is the index of the cell counting along rows and down
columns (and the extension of that for 3-D).
This allows easy plotting of a `raster' plot of spiketimes, with one
line for each cell.
The timestep, first id, last id, and number of data points per cell are
written in a header, indicated by a '#' at the beginning of the line.

If compatible_output is False, the raw format produced by the simulator
is used. This may be faster, since it avoids any post-processing of the
spike files.

For parallel simulators, if gather is True, all data will be gathered
to the master node and a single output file created there. Otherwise, a
file will be written on each node, containing only the cells simulated
on that node.


**print_gsyn(self, file, gather=True, compatible_output=True)**

Write synaptic conductance traces to file.

file should be either a filename or a PyNN File object.

If compatible_output is True, the format is "t g cell_id",
where cell_id is the index of the cell counting along rows and down
columns (and the extension of that for 3-D).
The timestep, first id, last id, and number of data points per cell are
written in a header, indicated by a '#' at the beginning of the line.
If compatible_output is False, the raw format produced by the simulator
is used. This may be faster, since it avoids any post-processing of the
voltage files.


**print_v(self, file, gather=True, compatible_output=True)**

Write membrane potential traces to file.

file should be either a filename or a PyNN File object.

If compatible_output is True, the format is "v cell_id",

columns (and the extension of that for 3-D).
The timestep, first id, last id, and number of data points per cell are
written in a header, indicated by a '#' at the beginning of the line.

If compatible_output is False, the raw format produced by the simulator
is used. This may be faster, since it avoids any post-processing of the
voltage files.

For parallel simulators, if gather is True, all data will be gathered
to the master node and a single output file created there. Otherwise, a
file will be written on each node, containing only the cells simulated
on that node.

random values.


**record(self, record_from=None, rng=None, to_file=True)**

If record_from is not given, record spikes from all cells in the Population.

If record_from is not given, record the membrane potential for all cells in
the Population.
record_from can be an integer - the number of cells to record from, chosen
at random (in this case a random number generator can also be supplied)
- or a list containing the ids of the cells to record.


**rset(self, parametername, rand_distr)**

'Random' set. Set the value of parametername to a value taken from
rand_distr, which should be a !RandomDistribution object.


**set(self, param, val=None)**

Set one or more parameters for every cell in the population.

param can be a dict, in which case val should not be supplied, or a string
giving the parameter name, in which case val is the parameter value.
val can be a numeric value, or list of such (e.g. for setting spike times).

e.g. p.set("tau_m",20.0).

     p.set({'tau_m':20,'v_rest':-65})


**tset(self, parametername, value_array)**

'Topographic' set. Set the value of parametername to the values in
value_array, which must have the same dimensions as the Population.

             1D array with at least as many items as connections to be
             created. Units nA.

Each post-synaptic neuron is connected to exactly n pre-synaptic neurons
chosen at random.

If n is less than the size of the pre-synaptic population, there are no
multiple connections, i.e., no instances of the same pair of neurons being
multiply connected. If n is greater than the size of the pre-synaptic
population, all possible single connections are made before starting to add
duplicate connections.

**__init__(self, n, allow_self_connections=True, weights=0.0, delays=None)**

Create a new connector.

       number of pre-synaptic neurons is drawn from this distribution
       for each post-synaptic neuron.

`allow_self_connections` -- if the connector is used to connect a
    Population to itself, this flag determines whether a neuron is

chosen at random.

If n is less than the size of the post-synaptic population, there are no
multiple connections, i.e., no instances of the same pair of neurons being
multiply connected. If n is greater than the size of the post-synaptic
population, all possible single connections are made before starting to add
duplicate connections.

**__init__(self, n, allow_self_connections=True, weights=0.0, delays=None)**

Create a new connector.

`n` -- either a positive integer, or a `!RandomDistribution` that produces
       positive integers. If `n` is a `!RandomDistribution`, then the
       number of post-synaptic neurons is drawn from this distribution
       for each pre-synaptic neuron.

`allow_self_connections` -- if the connector is used to connect a
       Population to itself, this flag determines whether a neuron is

       Population.

`weights` -- may either be a float, a !RandomDistribution object, a list/
             1D array with at least as many items as connections to be

               where pre_addr is the address (a tuple) of the presynaptic
               neuron, and post_addr is the address of the postsynaptic
               neuron.


----


FromFileConnector
-----------------

Make connections according to a list read from a file.

**__init__(self, filename, distributed=False)**

Create a new connector.

`filename` -- name of a text file containing a list of connections, in
              the format required by `!FromListConnector`.

`distributed` -- if this is True, then each node will read connections
                 from a file called `filename.x`, where `x` is the MPI
                 rank. This speeds up loading connections for
                 distributed simulations.

**__init__(self, mean, stdev, dt=None, start=0.0, stop=None, rng=None)**

Construct the current source.

        Required arguments:

            mean  -- mean current amplitude in nA

The random module
=================

----

NumpyRNG
--------

Wrapper for the numpy.random.!RandomState class (Mersenne Twister PRNG).

**__getattr__(self, name)**

This is to give the PyNN RNGs the same methods as the wrapped RNGs (
numpy.random.!RandomState or the GSL RNGs.


**__init__(self, seed=None, rank=0, num_processes=1, parallel_safe=True)**

**describe(self)**

**next(self, n=1, distribution='uniform', parameters=[], mask_local=None)**

Return n random numbers from the distribution.

        If n >= 0, return a numpy array,
        if n < 0, raise an Exception.


----


GSLRNG
------

Wrapper for the GSL random number generators.

**__getattr__(self, name)**

This is to give GSLRNG the same methods as the GSL RNGs.


**__init__(self, seed=None, type='mt19937', rank=0, num_processes=1, parallel_safe=True)**

**next(self, n=1, distribution='uniform', parameters=[], mask_local=None)**

Return n random numbers from the distribution.

        If n >= 0, return a numpy array,
        if n < 0, raise an Exception.


----


NativeRNG
---------

Signals that the simulator's own native RNG should be used.
Each simulator module should implement a class of the same name which
inherits from this and which sets the seed appropriately.

**__init__(self, seed=None)**

**next(self, n=1, distribution='uniform', parameters=[])**

Return n random numbers from the distribution.

        If n is 1, return a float, if n > 1, return a Numpy array,
        if n <= 0, raise an Exception.


----


RandomDistribution
------------------

Class which defines a next(n) method which returns an array of n random
numbers from a given distribution.

**__init__(self, distribution='uniform', parameters=[], rng=None, boundaries=None, constrain='clip')**

If present, rng should be a NumpyRNG or GSLRNG object.
distribution should be the name of a method supported by the underlying
    random number generator object.

parameters should be a list or tuple containing the arguments expected
    by the underlying method in the correct order. named arguments are
    not yet supported.

boundaries is a tuple (min, max) used to specify explicitly, for distribution
    like Gaussian, Gamma or others, hard boundaries for the parameters. If
    parameters are drawn outside those boundaries, the policy applied will depend
    on the constrain parameter.

constrain control the policy for weights out of the specified boundaries.
    If "clip", random numbers are clipped to the boundaries.
    If "redraw", random numbers are drawn till they fall within the boundaries.

Note that NumpyRNG and GSLRNG distributions may not have the same names,
    e.g., 'normal' for NumpyRNG and 'gaussian' for GSLRNG, and the
    arguments may also differ.


**next(self, n=1, mask_local=None)**

Return n random numbers from the distribution.

----

The utility module
==================

colour(col, text)
-----------------


notify(msg='Simulation finished.', subject='Simulation finished.', smtphost=None, address=None)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Send an e-mail stating that the simulation has finished.



get_script_args(n_args, usage='')
---------------------------------

Get command line arguments.

This works by finding the name of the main script and assuming any
arguments after this in sys.argv are arguments to the script.
It would be nicer to use optparse, but this doesn't seem to work too well
with nrniv or mpirun.



init_logging(logfile, debug=False, num_processes=1, rank=0)
-----------------------------------------------------------

----

Timer
-----

For timing script execution.

**time_in_words(s)**

Formats a time in seconds as a string containing the time in days,
        hours, minutes, seconds. Examples::

            >>> time_in_words(1)
            1 second
            >>> time_in_words(123)
            2 minutes, 3 seconds
            >>> time_in_words(24*3600)
            1 day


**__init__(self)**

**diff(self, format=None)**

Return the time since the last time elapsedTime() or diff() was called.


**elapsedTime(self, format=None)**

Return the elapsed time in seconds but keep the clock running.
