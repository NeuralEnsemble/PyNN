Contributing to PyNN
====================

Mailing list
============

Discussions about PyNN take place in the `NeuralEnsemble Google Group`_.


Setting up a development environment
====================================

We strongly suggest you work in a virtual environment, e.g. using virtualenv_ or Anaconda.

Requirements
------------

In addition to the requirements listed in :doc:`../installation`, you will need to
install:

    * pytest_
    * coverage_

to run tests, and:

    * Sphinx_
    * matplotlib

to build the documentation.

Code checkout
-------------

PyNN development is based around GitHub. Once you have a GitHub account, you
should fork_ the official `PyNN repository`_, and then clone your fork to your
local machine::

    $ git clone https://github.com/<username>/PyNN.git pyNN_dev

To work on the development version::

    $ git checkout master

To keep your PyNN repository up-to-date with respect to the official
repository, add it as a remote::

    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/PyNN.git

and then you can pull in any upstream changes::

    $ git pull upstream master


To get PyNN onto your :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` there are many options, such as:

    * pip editable mode (`pip install -e /path/to/PyNN`)
    * creating a symbolic link named :file:`pyNN` from somewhere that is already
      on your :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`, such as the :file:`site-packages` directory,
      to the :file:`pyNN_dev/pyNN` directory.

Coding style
============

We try to stay fairly close to PEP8_. Please note in particular:

    - indentation of four spaces, no tabs
    - single space around most operators, but no space around the '=' sign when
      used to indicate a keyword argument or a default parameter value.
    - some function/method names in PyNN use ``mixedCase``, but these will
      gradually be deprecated and replaced with ``lower_case_with_underscores``.
      Any new functions or methods should use the latter.
    - we currently target versions 3.8+


Testing
=======

Running the PyNN test suite requires the *pytest_* package,
and optionally the *pytest-cov* package. To run the entire test suite::

    $ pytest

To see how well the codebase is covered by the tests, run::

    $ pytest --cov=pyNN --cov-report term --cov-report html

There are currently two sorts of tests, unit tests, which aim to exercise
small pieces of code such as individual functions and methods, and system tests,
which aim to test that all the pieces of the system work together as expected.

If you add a new feature to PyNN, or fix a bug, you should write both unit and
system tests.

Unit tests should where necessary make use of mock/fake/stub/dummy objects to
isolate the component under test as well as possible. The :mod:`pyNN.mock`
module is a complete mock simulator backend that may be used for this purpose.
Except when testing a specific simulator interface, unit tests should be able to
run without a simulator installed.

System tests should be written so that they can run with any of the simulators.
The suggested way to do this is to write test functions
that take a simulator module as an argument, and then wrap these functions
with the following decorator::

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("sim", (pyNN.nest, pyNN.neuron, pyNN.brian2))

To run only the tests within a file
named 'test_electrodes' located inside system/scenarios, use::

    $ pytest test/system/scenarios/test_electrodes.py

To run a single specific test named 'test_changing_electrode' located within
some file (and added to registry) inside system/scenarios, use::

    $ pytest test/system/scenarios/test_electrodes.py::test_changing_electrode


Submitting code
===============

The best way to get started with contributing code to PyNN is to fix a small
bug (`bugs marked "minor" in the bug tracker`_) in your checkout of
the code. Once you are happy with your changes, **run the test suite again to check
that you have not introduced any new bugs**. If this is your first contribution
to the project, please add your name and affiliation/employer to :file:`AUTHORS`.

After committing the changes to your local repository::

    $ git commit -m 'informative commit message'

first pull in any changes from the upstream repository::

    $ git pull upstream master

then push to your own account on GitHub::

    $ git push

Now, via the GitHub web interface, open a pull request.


Documentation
=============

PyNN documentation is generated using Sphinx_.

To build the documentation in HTML format, run::

    $ make html

in the ``doc`` subdirectory of the source tree. Many of the files contain
examples of interactive Python sessions. The validity of this code can be tested
by running::

    $ make doctest

PyNN documentation is hosted at http://neuralensemble.org/docs/PyNN


Making a release
================

To make a release of PyNN requires you to have permissions to upload PyNN
packages to the `Python Package Index`_, and to
upload documentation to the neuralensemble.org server. If you are interested
in becoming release manager for PyNN, please contact us via the `mailing list`_.

When you think a release is ready, run through the following checklist one
last time:

    * do all the tests pass? This means running :command:`pytest` in
      :file:`test/unittests` and :file:`test/system` and running :command:`make doctest` in
      :file:`doc`. You should do this on at least two Linux systems -- one a very
      recent version and one at least a year old, and on at least one version of
      Mac OS X. You should also do this with multiple Python versions (3.7+).
    * do all the example scripts generate the correct output? Run the
      :file:`run_all_examples.py` script in :file:`examples/tools` and then visually
      check the :file:`.png` files generated in :file:`examples/tools/Results`. Again,
      you should do this on at least two Linux systems and one Mac OS X system.
    * does the documentation build without errors? You should then at least skim
      the generated HTML pages to check for obvious problems.
    * have you updated the version numbers in :file:`pyproject.toml`, :file:`pyNN/__init__.py`,
      :file:`doc/conf.py` and :file:`doc/installation.txt`?
    * have you updated the changelog?

Once you've confirmed all the above, create source and wheel packages using::

    $ python -m build

and check that they install properly (you will find them in the :file:`dist`
subdirectory).

Now you should commit any changes, then tag with the release number as follows::

    $ git tag x.y.z

where ``x.y.z`` is the release number. You should now upload the documentation
to http://neuralensemble.org/docs/PyNN/ by updating the `neuralensemble.github.io`
repository (in the :file:`docs/PyNN` directory).

If this is a final release, there are a few more steps:

    * if it is a major release (i.e. an ``x.y.0`` release), create a new bug-fix
      branch::

        $ git branch x.y

    * upload the packages to PyPI (Do **not** upload development releases to PyPI)::

        $ twine upload dist/PyNN-x.y.z*

    * update the :file:`codemeta.json` file

    * make an announcement on the `mailing list`_

    * if it is a major release, write a blog post about it with a focus on the
      new features and major changes

    * go home, take a headache pill and lie down for a while in a darkened room (-;
